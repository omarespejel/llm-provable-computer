# Appendix: Public System Comparison Snapshot

Snapshot date: **April 24, 2026**

This appendix is a compact comparison table for the three systems most relevant to the
argument in the main paper. It inherits its source posture from Sections 6 and 7:
archival papers, official engineering/product materials, and commit-pinned repository
artifacts are used for different claim types and should not be read as a single matched
benchmark class.

Sources: rows inherit the main paper’s source set from Sections 6 and 7, especially
References 24-31, 35-40, 46, and 49.

It should be read with one rule in mind: these are **not** matched end-to-end benchmarks
on identical workloads. They are a structured comparison of public claims, committed
artifacts, and implementation scope.

| Main caveat               | Strong public claims, but not directly comparable to STARK systems on identical workloads        | Public materials mix benchmark claims, verification demos, and roadmap claims; verifier docs still show uneven component maturity (`Attention` remains `Prover only`)               | Narrow scope: local S-two wins now split by regime (proving bundle, typed boundary latency, and handoff-receipt size), not a matched full-model benchmark or universal win |

## How to use this appendix

Use this appendix when the main paper needs one concise comparison object, but keep the
stronger qualifications in the main text:

- DeepProve is the strongest counterexample to categorical anti-SNARK claims.
- BitSage is the strongest public STARK-native comparator, but public evidence should be
  separated into benchmark claims, onchain demos, and broader roadmap scope.
- `provable-transformer-vm` is not a frontier zkML prover; it is a trace-semantics and
  proof-architecture artifact with reproducible evidence and an explicit pre-recursive
  aggregation boundary.
- If you need one narrow verifier-object comparison rather than another full-model row,
  use `NANOZK`'s abstract `d <= 128` layer-proof row (`5.5 KB`, `24 ms` verify) against
  this repo's `Phase71` handoff-receipt row (`1,533` serialized bytes, `34.613 ms`
  verify) as a compact-object calibration only, not a matched benchmark.
