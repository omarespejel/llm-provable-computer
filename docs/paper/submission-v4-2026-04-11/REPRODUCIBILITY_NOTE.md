# Reproducibility Note (One Page)

This note describes how to reproduce the publication-facing paper artifacts for
**On the Structural Fit of Transformer Workloads and STARK Proof Systems**
under the rolling base tag `paper-publication-v4-2026-04-11` once cut.
The tag should resolve to a commit that contains this v4 paper metadata. The
carried-state aggregation evidence remains pinned to the Phase 28 proof-carrying
aggregation checkpoint commit `6ff972ddda4051d73dc65c92a88c0d00683ec8c7`, with
the dedicated bundle index cited at commit
`be9c4e47a9b774e7fdbccf7cdc6977c11b39dcd6`.

## 1) Scope and Intended Reproduction Target

The target is reproducibility of:

- paper text and references,
- appendix artifacts and evidence pointers,
- figure-generating scripts and TSV outputs,
- frozen artifact index manifests for the evidence tiers, including the Phase 28 proof-carrying aggregation bundle.

This package is intentionally a **research artifact snapshot**, not a claim of
production-scale zkML deployment.

## 2) Environment

Minimum practical setup:

- Python 3.9+,
- Rust toolchain used by the repository CI,
- dependencies from `scripts/requirements.txt`.

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

## 3) Paper Integrity / Preflight Check

Run:

```bash
python3 scripts/paper/paper_preflight.py --repo-root .
```

This verifies:

- local citation integrity for files with local references sections,
- immutable-link policy for this repository's GitHub links (commit-pinned),
- local figure/link path existence,
- standalone source note presence for system-comparison appendix.

Warnings about unused references are informational; errors fail the check.

## 4) Figure and Data Regeneration

Regenerate Section 4 artifacts:

```bash
python3 scripts/paper/generate_section4_ratio_figure.py
python3 scripts/paper/generate_section4_decomposition_figure.py
```

Expected outputs live under:

- `docs/paper/figures/section4-ratio-vs-context.*`
- `docs/paper/figures/section4-decomposition-vs-context.*`

Use git status to detect reproducibility drift quickly:

```bash
git status --short docs/paper/figures
```

Then inspect exact renderer-level drift with:

```bash
git diff -- docs/paper/figures
```

Numeric TSV outputs should be stable for a fixed code path; renderer-specific
binary/metadata drift (PDF/SVG/PNG) can occur across local plotting stacks.

## 5) Frozen Evidence Tiers

Primary frozen bundle index:

- `docs/paper/artifacts/production-v1-2026-04-04/APPENDIX_ARTIFACT_INDEX.md`

Frozen experimental `stwo` bundle index:

- `docs/paper/artifacts/stwo-experimental-v1-2026-04-06/APPENDIX_ARTIFACT_INDEX.md`

Phase 28 proof-carrying aggregation bundle index:

- `docs/paper/artifacts/stwo-proof-carrying-aggregation-v1-2026-04-11/APPENDIX_ARTIFACT_INDEX.md`

These indexes contain commit anchors, command logs, hashes, and artifact paths.

## 6) External Evidence Snapshot

Primary evidence manifest:

- `docs/paper/evidence/web-2026-04-06/manifest.tsv`
- `docs/paper/evidence/web-2026-04-06/manifest.json`

This records the source set used for infrastructure/system-state claims at the
time of packaging.

## 7) Consistency Sweep Before Sharing

Before sharing a draft externally, verify:

1. author names and affiliations are confirmed,
2. title, subtitle, and claim posture are aligned between:
   - `docs/paper/stark-transformer-alignment-2026.md`
   - `docs/paper/PUBLICATION_RELEASE.md`
3. paper preflight passes,
4. the Phase 28 bundle checksum files validate locally or in a clean reproduction environment,
5. release tag and commit references are consistent with the single main paper.

If additional reviewer feedback lands, patch on top and cut a follow-up
publication tag rather than mutating existing evidence claims.
